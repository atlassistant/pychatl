  # You can defines:
  #   - Intents
  #   - Entities (with or without variants)
  #   - Synonyms
  #   - Comments (only at the top level)

  # Inside an intent, you got training data.
  # Training data can refer to one or more entities and/or synonyms, they will be used
  # by generators to generate all possible permutations and training samples.

    ~[greet] some training data @[date]
    another training data that uses an @[entity] at @[date#with_variant]

  ~[greet]

  # Entities contains available samples and could refer to a synonym.

  @[entity]
    some value
    other value

  # Synonyms contains only raw values

  ~[a synonym]
    possible synonym

  # Entities and intents can define arbitrary properties that will be made available
  # to generators.
  # For snips, `type` and `extensible` are used for example.

  @[date](type=snips/datetime)

    today

  # Variants is used only to generate training sample with specific values that should
  # maps to the same entity name, here `date`. Props will be merged with the root entity.
